# Zyla

The fastest full-stack headless commerce platform in the world.

# Overview

Zyla is the fastest end-to-end headless commerce stack that blends cutting-edge content management and commerce tools that can accept payments and ship worldwide on deployment.

# Requirements

* [Dola](https://dola.me) merchant account 
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

# Getting Started

1. Go to [zyla.rocks](https://zyla.rocks) and click `Deploy Now`
2. Select your [Starter Kit](#starter-kits)
3. Finalize your project details
4. Deploy!

Once your project has been deployed on Vercel, you'll receive a public URL with an SSL automatically applied.

To add your own domain, read the [Custom Domains](https://vercel.com/docs/custom-domains) guide on Vercel.

Note, domains typically get applied within minutes; however, it may take 24-48 hours for your DNS to fully resolve.

# Starter Kits

Each starter kit comes integrated with [BEP](https://bep.life) and [Dola](https://dola.me), and preconfigured to be 1-click deployable on Vercel using `Deploy Now`.

### BEP

B.E.P. or Backendless Ecommerce Platform turns any website into a shop with just 1-line of code, no backend or CMS required. Plus, it's free, minus standard processing fees (2.9% + $0.30, per transaction).

### Dola

Dola is a 1-click checkout and digital wallet. Unlike Apple, Google, or Shop Pay, Dola works on every browser and device, and is platform agnostic.
